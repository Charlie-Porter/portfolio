## Step 4: Images

If you're using images from the `public` folder and serving them with Next.js's `<Image />` component, they won't work out of the box with static site generation. This is because there's no automatic handling of path prefixes for images.

Next.js provides a way to automatically prepend assets like `.css` files with your GitHub repository name, but this does not apply to images served by the Next.js `<Image />` component. To work around this limitation, you need to prefix the path manually. Hereâ€™s a simple approach:

### Setting Up a Prefix

In the `utils` folder, create a `prefix.ts` file:

```typescript
const prefix = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH || "";

export { prefix };
```

```typescript

<Image src={`${prefix}/vercel.svg`} alt="Vercel Logo" width={72} height={16} />

```
